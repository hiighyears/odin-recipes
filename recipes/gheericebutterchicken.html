    <p><strong> Ghee Rice </strong>is a fragrant and flavorful Indian dish made by cooking basmati rice in aromatic ghee (clarified butter) along with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. The result is a rich, buttery rice that perfectly complements a variety of curries or grilled meats.

          <strong>Butter Chicken</strong>,or <strong>Murgh Makhani</strong>,  is a popular Indian dish featuring tender, marinated chicken cooked in a creamy tomato sauce rich with butter, cream, and spices. It has a mildly spiced, velvety sauce that pairs beautifully with naan or ghee rice.</p>
