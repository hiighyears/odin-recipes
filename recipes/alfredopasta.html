    <p><strong> Alfredo Pasta</strong> is a classic Italian dish known for its rich and creamy sauce, typically made with butter, 
        heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. 
        The sauce coats the pasta to create a
         velvety texture that's indulgent and satisfying.
          Traditionally served with fettuccine, this dish has evolved to include various additions 
          like garlic, parsley, and sometimes chicken or shrimp for added flavor and protein. Alfredo Pasta is a go-to comfort food, perfect for a
           quick weeknight dinner or a special meal that
           feels both elegant and delicious.</p>
           <h4>Ingredients</h4>
           <ul><li>Fettuccine pasta – 12 oz (340g)</li>
        <li>Butter – 1/2 cup (1 stick, unsalted)
        </li>
        <li>Heavy cream – 1 cup</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese – 1 cup, freshly grated</li>
        <li>Garlic – 2 cloves, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt – to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper – to taste</li>
        <li>	Fresh parsley – chopped, for garnish (optional)</li></ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol><li>	Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain the pasta and reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water. Set aside</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. If using, add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but not browned</li>
        <li>	Pour in the heavy cream and stir continuously. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer (not a boil), and cook for 3-5 minutes until it thickens slightly</li>
        <li>Gradually stir in the freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Stir constantly until the cheese melts completely and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can thin it with a small amount of the reserved pasta water</li>
        <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly with the Alfredo sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add more of the reserved pasta water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency</li>
        <li>	Transfer the pasta to serving plates. Garnish with additional grated Parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, and a sprinkle of black pepper or red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>If adding grilled chicken, shrimp, or sautéed mushrooms, mix them into the pasta before serving</li>

        </ol>
