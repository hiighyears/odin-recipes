    <p> <strong>Gyoza</strong> are Japanese dumplings that are filled with a savory mixture of ground meat (typically pork), finely chopped vegetables like cabbage, and aromatic ingredients such as garlic and ginger. Known for their crispy bottoms and tender steamed tops, gyoza are first pan-fried to achieve a golden, crunchy texture, then steamed to perfection. These bite-sized dumplings are often served with a tangy dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of chili oil for heat. Popular as an appetizer or side dish, gyoza are a beloved staple in Japanese cuisine, perfect for any occasion.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground pork (or chicken or shrimp) – 200 grams</li>
        <li>Cabbage – 1/4 head, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Green onions – 2 stalks, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Garlic – 2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Ginger – 1 small knob, grated</li>
        <li>Soy sauce – 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Sesame oil – 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Salt – 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Pepper – to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine ground pork, cabbage, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Take a gyoza wrapper and place it on your palm. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the filling into the center of the wrapper.</li>
        <li>Dip your finger in water and lightly wet the edges of the wrapper.</li>
        <li>Fold the wrapper in half to form a semicircle, pinching the edges together. Pleat the edges to seal the gyoza securely.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place the gyoza in the skillet, flat side down. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once the bottoms are browned, add 1/4 cup of water to the skillet and cover immediately. Let the gyoza steam for about 4-5 minutes, or until the water evaporates and the filling is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the gyoza to a plate and serve hot with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a few drops of chili oil (optional).</li>
    </ol>
